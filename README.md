<h1> POSTURE ALERT </h2>

<p> Posture Alert is a python app that alerts you if you lean forward from a pre-calibrated position. </p>

<p> It uses OpenCV for face distance estimation. On starting the app asks the user to maintain a comfortable posture for 2s. If the user leans forward by more than 1.2 times(can be changed), the app alerts by sending a notification. </p>

<p> The app GUI has been made using PyQT5</p>
